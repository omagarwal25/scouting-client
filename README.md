# scouting-client
A react-native app for scouting out teams at FRC comps

Paper getting hard to manage? Use scounting client to record teams on your phone and then save the data into a QR code. This is designed for events where wifi coverage is limited. The "server" app is coming later and will allow you to save all the data into a csv and generate codes for your scounts to scan to get their assignments.
